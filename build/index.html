Having been a part of this fraternity for the past 3 years, I can attest to the overwhelming professional and personal development this organization has given me. Starting off as a doe-eyed freshman, joining PSE helped me grow into a well-rounded business woman prepared to conquer anything and everything that comes my way. PSE is my home away from home--my family here at UC Berkeley.</p><br><p class="font-md shift-left">Yes, we teach you the foundations of marketing, finance, consulting, and so much more; however, you will also learn about humility, brotherhood, and teamwork. PSE represents a diverse range of majors from Business to Global Studies to Cognitive Science, and this is what makes us different. We seek diversity to uphold an interdisciplinary approach and implement equity and inclusion practices to ensure everyone’s voices are heard. PSE has supported and allowed me to excel through my years as a Golden Bear and today I am grateful to give back to an organization that has generously given me so much. Joining PSE will provide you with a robust professional experience helping not only expand your network and knowledge of business and marketing, but also providing you with a community of diverse individuals who will shape your confidence and character. Most students come into UC Berkeley completely lost; I know I did. UC Berkeley academics are challenging and rigorous, but joining an organization like PSE will give you a network of friends and a place to call home. What are you waiting for?
