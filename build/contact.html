We prepare our brothers with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in today's business world, but we also go further to provide opportunities to utilize and hone these skills within projects across various industries. PSE hosts networking opportunities and corporate infosessions with professionals and alumni, and puts its members in positions to become their best possible professional selves. But, PSE provides far more than professional development - as a fraternity, we are an intimate, close-knit community where brothers can build strong personal relationships, and lasting friendships.</p></div></div></div><div class="acc"><h3>Are all recruitment events mandatory?</h3><div class="answer"><div class="answer-inner"><p>You must attend at least one of the three recruitment events (Meet the Chapter, Social Mixer, Case Workshop) to be considered for an interview. The greater the number of events you attend, the more chances you have to meet the brothers and vice versa, and the better we will be able to learn about you.</p></div></div></div><div class="acc"><h3>What if I can't attend a recruitment event?</h3><div class="answer"><div class="answer-inner"><p>Recruitment events are designed for you to meet our brothers and familiarize yourself with Pi Sigma Epsilon. If you can’t make a recruitment event and would like to chat personally with one of our brothers instead, please contact berkeleypse.recruiting@gmail.com. You’re welcome to indicate your availability for a coffee chat and one of our brothers will reach out to you!</p></div></div></div><div class="acc"><h3>Is there a GPA minimum?</h3><div class="answer"><div class="answer-inner"><p>There is no GPA minimum since we consider applicants holistically! PMT is a rigous process that has a history of negatively affecting GPA. Professional development is the PM Trainers highest priority and we do not want to jeaopardize your academic performance.</p></div></div></div><div class="acc"><h3>What is the time commitment for a prospective member?</h3><div class="answer"><div class="answer-inner"><p>The time commitment for a prospective member (PM) will incrementally change as the process continues. PMs are expected to attend a 3 hour weekly PM training on Monday nights in addition to contributing several hours per week for the first few weeks, and progressively more in the final weeks of training.</p></div></div></div><div class="acc"><h3>Is there an age/year ceiling?</h3><div class="answer"><div class="answer-inner"><p>We do not have an age requirement, but you must be an undergraduate student with at least 3 semesters remaining (including your semester as a prospective member). First-semester freshmen are welcome to apply!</p></div></div></div><div class="acc"><h3>I'm not a Business or Economics major. Can I still join?</h3><div class="answer"><div class="answer-inner"><p>Of course! We love diversity. Close to half of our brothers are not majoring in Business or Economics. The brother who built this website is a Computer Science major. You're more than welcome to join.</p></div></div></div><div class="acc"><h3>How many PMs does PSE accept each semester?</h3><div class="answer"><div class="answer-inner"><p>It depends. If there are 20 recruits who are qualified then we will accept 20. If there is only one, we'll accept them. On average, however, we tend to accept around 12 recruits per semester</p></div></div></div><div class="acc"><h3>Why do you not use terms such as "rush" or "pledge"?</h3><div class="answer"><div class="answer-inner"><p>PSE is a professional fraternity, and thus we choose to use terminology that reflects our professional attitude, character, and purpose. Terms such as "recruitment," "prospective member," "prospective member training," and "PM Trainer," are used in lieu of "rush," "pledge," "pledge process," and "pledgemaster," in any verbal or written communication involving participation or membership in Pi Sigma Epsilon.</p></div></div></div><div class="acc"><h3>Will I be hazed as a prospective member?</h3><div class="answer"><div class="answer-inner"><p>Absolutely not. PSE respects the time and health of its prospective members. We actively encourage our PMs to raise any concerns to their PM trainers throughout the training process. PMs should expect to be challenged but should not sacrifice any aspect of health for PSE.</p></div></div></div><div class="acc"><h3>Where can I ask more questions?</h3><div class="answer"><div class="answer-inner"><p>Fill out our contact form or direct any questions to <b>berkeleypse.recruiting@gmail.com</b> and we'll get back to you as soon as possible!</p></div></div></div></div><script>$(document).ready(function(){
